This is a simple paint app that primarily uses jQuery. One can change the small black boxes to a different color by first clicking the tab of the color you would like to change the box to, and then left-clicking on the box. When the box is clicked it will then change to that color. One can change to another color by simply clicking a different color tab, or reset to clear out all boxes changed to that color (or to return them to black).
